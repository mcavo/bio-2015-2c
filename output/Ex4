# * Regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) signatures and profile *
# **********************************************************************
# 
# The regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) [1]  is  a  eukaryotic protein
# which binds  to  chromatin  and  interacts  with  ran,  a  nuclear GTP-binding
# protein (see <PDOC00859>),  to promote the loss of bound GDP and the uptake of
# fresh GTP,  thus  acting as a guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulator (GDS)
# [2]. The  interaction of RCC1 with ran probably plays an important role in the
# regulation of gene expression.
# 
# RCC1, known  as    PRP20  or  SRM1  in yeast, pim1 in fission yeast and BJ1 in
# Drosophila, is  a  protein  that  contains seven tandem repeats of a domain of
# about 50   to   60   amino   acids.   As  shown  in  the  following  schematic
# representation, the  repeats  make  up  the  major  part  of the length of the
# protein. Outside the repeat region, there is just a small N-terminal domain of
# about 40  to  50  residues  and,  in the Drosophila protein only, a C-terminal
# domain of about 130 residues.

# 
# RCC1 repeats are also found in the following proteins:
# 
#  - Mammalian  retinitis  pigmentosa  GTPase regulator (RPGR) [3]. Mutations in
#    the RPGR  gene  cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa type 3 (RP3), a severe,
#    progressive and  degenerative  retinal   dystrophy  eventually  leading  to
#    complete blindness.
#  - Mammalian HERC2 protein. A putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor that
#    could be involved in protein trafficking.
# 
# We developed  two  signature patterns for RCC1.  The  first is found in the N-
# terminal part  of  the second repeat; this is the most conserved part of RCC1.
# The second  is derived from conserved positions in the C-terminal part of each
# repeat and detects up to five copies of the repeated domain. We also developed
# a profile that covers the whole repeat.

# * Microbodies C-terminal targeting signal *
# *******************************************
# 
# Microbodies are  a class of small, single membraned organelles to which belong
# peroxisomes, glyoxysomes,  and  glycosomes. Microbody proteins are synthesized
# on free polysomes and imported into the organelle post-translationally. Unlike
# the import  of  proteins  into  mitochondria, chloroplasts or the ER/secretion
# pathway, import  into  microbodies does not generally require the removal of a
# presequence [1].  It  has  been  experimentally  shown  [2,3,4]  that, in some
# peroxisomal proteins,  the  targeting  signal  (PTS) resides in the last three
# amino acids  of  the  C-terminus.  This consensus sequence is known as 'S-K-L'
# (Ser-Lys-Leu), although some variations are allowed in all three positions. As
# the peroxisomal  targeting  signal  also  seems  to    be  recognized by other
# microbodies, it  is now [1] known as the C-terminal microbody targeting signal
# (CMTS).
# 
# It must  be noted that not all microbody proteins contain a CMTS; some seem to
# contain an  internal  CMTS-like  sequence,  but  it  is not yet known if it is
# active as such. Finally, a  few  proteins are  synthesized  with an N-terminal
# presequence which is cleaved off during import.
# 
# Microbody proteins known or thought to contain a CMTS are listed below.
# 
#  - Mammalian D-amino acid oxidase.

# **************************
# 
# A structure,  referred to as the 'leucine zipper' [1,2], has been proposed  to
# explain  how some eukaryotic gene regulatory proteins work. The leucine zipper
# consist  of a  periodic  repetition  of  leucine  residues  at  every  seventh
# position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The segments containing
# these  periodic  arrays of leucine residues seem to exist in  an alpha-helical
# conformation. The leucine side chains extending from one alpha-helix  interact
# with those  from a similar alpha helix  of  a second polypeptide, facilitating
# dimerization; the structure formed by cooperation of these two regions forms a
# coiled coil [3]. The leucine zipper pattern is present in many gene regulatory
# proteins, such as:
# 
#  - The CCATT-box and enhancer binding protein (C/EBP).
#  - The cAMP response element (CRE) binding proteins (CREB, CRE-BP1, ATFs).
#  - The Jun/AP1 family of transcription factors.
#  - The yeast general control protein GCN4.
#  - The fos oncogene, and the fos-related proteins fra-1 and fos B.

# -Note: As this is far from being a specific  pattern you should be cautious in

# The precursor of  hormones  and other active  peptides  which are C-terminally
# amidated is always directly followed [1,2] by a glycine residue which provides
# the amide group, and  most often by at  least two  consecutive  basic residues
# (Arg or Lys) which generally function as an active peptide  precursor cleavage
# site.  Although all amino acids can be amidated,  neutral hydrophobic residues
# such as Val or Phe are good substrates, while  charged residues such as Asp or
# Arg  are much less reactive.  C-terminal  amidation has not  yet been shown to
# occur in unicellular organisms or in plants.

# * Microbodies C-terminal targeting signal *
# *******************************************
# 
# Microbodies are  a class of small, single membraned organelles to which belong
# peroxisomes, glyoxysomes,  and  glycosomes. Microbody proteins are synthesized
# on free polysomes and imported into the organelle post-translationally. Unlike
# the import  of  proteins  into  mitochondria, chloroplasts or the ER/secretion
# pathway, import  into  microbodies does not generally require the removal of a
# presequence [1].  It  has  been  experimentally  shown  [2,3,4]  that, in some
# peroxisomal proteins,  the  targeting  signal  (PTS) resides in the last three
# amino acids  of  the  C-terminus.  This consensus sequence is known as 'S-K-L'
# (Ser-Lys-Leu), although some variations are allowed in all three positions. As
# the peroxisomal  targeting  signal  also  seems  to    be  recognized by other
# microbodies, it  is now [1] known as the C-terminal microbody targeting signal
# (CMTS).
# 
# It must  be noted that not all microbody proteins contain a CMTS; some seem to
# contain an  internal  CMTS-like  sequence,  but  it  is not yet known if it is
# active as such. Finally, a  few  proteins are  synthesized  with an N-terminal
# presequence which is cleaved off during import.

# *****************************************
# * ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) *
# *****************************************
# 
# From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
# [1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that  bind ATP or GTP
# share a number of more or less conserved sequence motifs.   The best conserved
# of these  motifs  is  a  glycine-rich region, which typically forms a flexible
# loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop interacts with one of
# the phosphate  groups  of  the  nucleotide.   This sequence motif is generally
# referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] or the 'P-loop' [5].
# 
# There are numerous ATP- or GTP-binding proteins  in which the P-loop is found.
# We list below  a number of protein  families  for  which  the relevance of the
# presence of such motif has been noted:
# 
#  - ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits (see <PDOC00137>).
#  - Myosin heavy chains.
#  - Kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins (see <PDOC00343>).
#  - Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (see <PDOC00362>).
#  - Guanylate kinase (see <PDOC00670>).
#  - Thymidine kinase (see <PDOC00524>).
#  - Thymidylate kinase (see <PDOC01034>).
#  - Shikimate kinase (see <PDOC00868>).
#  - Nitrogenase iron protein family (nifH/chlL) (see <PDOC00580>).
#  - ATP-binding proteins involved  in 'active transport' (ABC transporters) [7]
#    (see <PDOC00185>).
#  - DNA and RNA helicases [8,9,10].
#  - GTP-binding elongation factors (EF-Tu, EF-1alpha, EF-G, EF-2, etc.).
#  - Ras family of GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ral, Ypt1, SEC4, etc.).
#  - Nuclear protein ran (see <PDOC00859>).
#  - ADP-ribosylation factors family (see <PDOC00781>).
#  - Bacterial dnaA protein (see <PDOC00771>).
#  - Bacterial recA protein (see <PDOC00131>).
#  - Bacterial recF protein (see <PDOC00539>).
#  - Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins alpha subunits (Gi, Gs, Gt, G0, etc.).
#  - DNA mismatch repair proteins mutS family (See <PDOC00388>).
#  - Bacterial type II secretion system protein E (see <PDOC00567>).
# 
# Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins are picked-up by this motif.  A number of
# proteins escape detection because the structure   of their ATP-binding site is
# completely different from that of the P-loop.  Examples  of  such proteins are
# the E1-E2 ATPases or  the  glycolytic kinases.   In  other ATP- or GTP-binding
# proteins the flexible loop exists  in a  slightly different form; this is  the
# case for tubulins or protein kinases.  A special mention must  be reserved for
# adenylate  kinase,  in  which  there  is a  single  deviation  from the P-loop
# pattern: in the last position Gly is found instead of Ser or Thr.
# 
# -Consensus pattern: [AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: a majority.
# -Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: in addition to the proteins  listed
#  above,  the 'A' motif is also  found in a number  of other proteins.  Most of
#  these proteins  probably  bind  a nucleotide, but others are definitively not
#  ATP- or GTP-binding (as for example  chymotrypsin,  or  human  ferritin light
#  chain).

# * Leucine zipper pattern *
# **************************
# 
# A structure,  referred to as the 'leucine zipper' [1,2], has been proposed  to
# explain  how some eukaryotic gene regulatory proteins work. The leucine zipper
# consist  of a  periodic  repetition  of  leucine  residues  at  every  seventh
# position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The segments containing
# these  periodic  arrays of leucine residues seem to exist in  an alpha-helical
# conformation. The leucine side chains extending from one alpha-helix  interact
# with those  from a similar alpha helix  of  a second polypeptide, facilitating
# dimerization; the structure formed by cooperation of these two regions forms a
# coiled coil [3]. The leucine zipper pattern is present in many gene regulatory
# proteins, such as:
# 
#  - The CCATT-box and enhancer binding protein (C/EBP).
#  - The cAMP response element (CRE) binding proteins (CREB, CRE-BP1, ATFs).
#  - The Jun/AP1 family of transcription factors.
#  - The yeast general control protein GCN4.
#  - The fos oncogene, and the fos-related proteins fra-1 and fos B.
#  - The C-myc, L-myc and N-myc oncogenes.
#  - The octamer-binding transcription factor 2 (Oct-2/OTF-2).
# 
# -Consensus pattern: L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: All    those
#  mentioned in the original paper, with the exception of L-myc which  has a Met
#  instead of the second Leu.
# -Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: some 600 other sequences from every
#  category of protein families.
# 
# -Note: As this is far from being a specific  pattern you should be cautious in

# * ATP-binding cassette, ABC transporter-type, signature and profile *
# *********************************************************************
# 
# ABC  transporters  belong  to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily which
# uses  the  hydrolysis  of  ATP  to  energize  diverse  biological systems. ABC
# transporters  are  minimally  constituted  of  two conserved regions: a highly
# conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain
# (TMD).  These  regions  can  be  found on the same protein or on two different
# ones.  Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted
# of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs [1].
# 
# ABC  transporters  are  involved  in the export or import of a wide variety of
# substrates  ranging  from  small ions to macromolecules. The major function of
# ABC  import  systems  is  to provide essential nutrients to bacteria. They are
# found  only  in  prokaryotes  and  their four constitutive domains are usually
# encoded  by  independent polypeptides (two ABC proteins and two TMD proteins).
# Prokaryotic importers  require  additional  extracytoplasmic  binding proteins
# (one or  more  per  systems)  for  function.  In  contrast, export systems are
# involved in  the  extrusion of noxious substances, the export of extracellular
# toxins and  the targeting of membrane components. They are found in all living
# organisms and  in  general  the TMD is fused to the ABC module in a variety of
# combinations. Some   eukaryotic   exporters   encode   the   four  domains  on
# the same polypeptide chain [2,3].
# 
# The  ABC  module  (approximately  two hundred amino acid residues) is known to
# bind  and  hydrolyze  ATP,  thereby  coupling transport to ATP hydrolysis in a
# large  number  of  biological processes. The cassette is duplicated in several
# subfamilies.  Its  primary  sequence is highly conserved, displaying a typical
# phosphate-binding loop:  Walker A  (see  <PDOC00017>), and a magnesium binding
# site:  Walker  B.  Besides these two regions, three other conserved motifs are
# present  in  the  ABC  cassette:  the switch region which contains a histidine
# loop,  postulated to polarize the attaching water molecule for hydrolysis, the
# signature  conserved  motif  (LSGGQ)  specific to the ABC transporter, and the
# Q-motif  (between  Walker A and the signature), which interacts with the gamma
# phosphate  through  a  water  bond.  The Walker A, Walker B, Q-loop and switch
# region form the nucleotide binding site [4,5,6].
# 
# The  3D  structure  of a monomeric ABC module adopts a stubby L-shape with two
# distinct  arms  (see  <PDB:1B0U>). ArmI (mainly beta-strand) contains Walker A
# and  Walker  B.  The  important residues for ATP hydrolysis and/or binding are
# located  in  the P-loop. The ATP-binding pocket is located at the extremity of
# armI. The perpendicular armII contains mostly the alpha helical subdomain with
# the  signature motif. It only seems to be required for structural integrity of
# the  ABC  module.  ArmII  is in direct contact with the TMD. The hinge between
# armI and armII contains both the histidine loop and the Q-loop, making contact
# with  the  gamma  phosphate  of  the  ATP  molecule. ATP hydrolysis leads to a
# conformational  change that could facilitate ADP release. In the dimer the two
# ABC  cassettes  contact  each  other  through  hydrophobic interactions at the
# antiparallel beta-sheet of armI by a two-fold axis [7,8,9,10,11,12].
# 
# Proteins  known  to belong to this family are classified in several functional
# subfamilies depending on the substrate used [E1].
#

#  - Protein-2 exporter: colicin V(cvaB).
#  - S-layer protein exporter (rsaD/sapD).
#  - Techoic Acid Exporter (tagH).
# 
# In eukaryotes:
# 
#  - ALDP, a peroxisomal protein involved in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
#  - Antigen  peptide  transporters  1  (TAP1,  PSF1,  RING4, HAM-1, mtp1) and 2
#    (TAP2, PSF2,  RING11, HAM-2, mtp2), which  are involved in the transport of
#    antigens from      the   cytoplasm  to  a  membrane-bound  compartment  for
#    association with MHC class I molecules.
#  - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR),  which  is most
#    probably involved in the transport of chloride ions.
#  - Drosophila  proteins  white  (w)  and brown (bw), which are involved in the
#    import of ommatidium screening pigments.
#  - Fungal elongation factor 3 (EF-3).
#  - Multidrug   transporters  (Mdr1)  (P-glycoprotein),  a  family  of  closely
#    related proteins which extrude a wide variety of drugs out of the cell.
#  - 70 Kd peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70).
#  - Sulfonylurea  receptor,  a  putative  subunit  of the B-cell  ATP-sensitive
#    potassium channel.
# 
# As a signature pattern for this class of proteins, we use a  conserved  region
# which is  located  between the 'A' and the 'B' motifs of the ATP-binding site.
# The  profile  we  developed  is  directed  against the conserved ABC module by

# to  them.  Our profile also recognizes the UvrA family which is evolutionarily
# related to the ABC transporter family.

# *******************************************
# 
# Microbodies are  a class of small, single membraned organelles to which belong
# peroxisomes, glyoxysomes,  and  glycosomes. Microbody proteins are synthesized
# on free polysomes and imported into the organelle post-translationally. Unlike
# the import  of  proteins  into  mitochondria, chloroplasts or the ER/secretion
# pathway, import  into  microbodies does not generally require the removal of a
# presequence [1].  It  has  been  experimentally  shown  [2,3,4]  that, in some
# peroxisomal proteins,  the  targeting  signal  (PTS) resides in the last three
# amino acids  of  the  C-terminus.  This consensus sequence is known as 'S-K-L'
# (Ser-Lys-Leu), although some variations are allowed in all three positions. As
# the peroxisomal  targeting  signal  also  seems  to    be  recognized by other
# microbodies, it  is now [1] known as the C-terminal microbody targeting signal
# (CMTS).
# 
# It must  be noted that not all microbody proteins contain a CMTS; some seem to
# contain an  internal  CMTS-like  sequence,  but  it  is not yet known if it is
# active as such. Finally, a  few  proteins are  synthesized  with an N-terminal
# presequence which is cleaved off during import.
# 
# Microbody proteins known or thought to contain a CMTS are listed below.

# **************************************************
# 
# Hemocyanins are copper-containing  oxygen  carriers occurring freely dissolved
# in the hemolymph of many molluscs  and  arthropods [1].  Arthropod hemocyanins
# consist  of  hexamer or  multi-hexamers with  subunits of about 75 Kd. Each of
# these subunits binds two copper ions.
# 
# Larval storage proteins (LSP) [2] are proteins  from the hemolymph of insects,
# which may serve as  a  store of  amino acids  for synthesis of adult proteins.
# There are two classes of LSP's: arylphorins,  which are rich in aromatic amino
# acids, and methionine-rich LSP's.  LSP's forms hexameric complexes.  LSP's are
# structurally related to arthropod hemocyanins.
# 
# In the lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni  a  protein  has  been  found [3] which is
# associated with larval metamorphosis.  This  protein,  which  is called acidic
# juvenile hormone-suppressible protein 1 (AJSP-1) is  also structurally related
# to arthropod hemocyanins.
# 
# As signature patterns for these  proteins  we selected  two conserved regions,
# the first  of  these  regions is located  in the  N-terminal  section of these
# proteins  and  include a conserved  histidine  residue  which, in hemocyanins,
# binds a copper atom.  The second pattern is located in the central part of the
# protein.
# 
# -Consensus pattern: Y-[FYW]-x-E-D-[LIVM]-x(2)-N-x(6)-H-x(3)-P
#                     [H is a copper ligand in hemocyanins]
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
#  most LSPs.

# * Microbodies C-terminal targeting signal *
# *******************************************
# 
# Microbodies are  a class of small, single membraned organelles to which belong
# peroxisomes, glyoxysomes,  and  glycosomes. Microbody proteins are synthesized
# on free polysomes and imported into the organelle post-translationally. Unlike
# the import  of  proteins  into  mitochondria, chloroplasts or the ER/secretion
# pathway, import  into  microbodies does not generally require the removal of a
# presequence [1].  It  has  been  experimentally  shown  [2,3,4]  that, in some
# peroxisomal proteins,  the  targeting  signal  (PTS) resides in the last three
# amino acids  of  the  C-terminus.  This consensus sequence is known as 'S-K-L'
# (Ser-Lys-Leu), although some variations are allowed in all three positions. As
# the peroxisomal  targeting  signal  also  seems  to    be  recognized by other
# microbodies, it  is now [1] known as the C-terminal microbody targeting signal
# (CMTS).
# 
# It must  be noted that not all microbody proteins contain a CMTS; some seem to
# contain an  internal  CMTS-like  sequence,  but  it  is not yet known if it is
# active as such. Finally, a  few  proteins are  synthesized  with an N-terminal
# presequence which is cleaved off during import.
# 
# Microbody proteins known or thought to contain a CMTS are listed below.
# 
#  - Mammalian D-amino acid oxidase.
#  - Mammalian acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (but not the fungal enzymes).
#  - Mammalian and yeast (S. cerevisiae) carnitine o-acetyltransferase.

# contain an  internal  CMTS-like  sequence,  but  it  is not yet known if it is
# active as such. Finally, a  few  proteins are  synthesized  with an N-terminal
# presequence which is cleaved off during import.
# 
# Microbody proteins known or thought to contain a CMTS are listed below.
# 
#  - Mammalian D-amino acid oxidase.
#  - Mammalian acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (but not the fungal enzymes).
#  - Mammalian and yeast (S. cerevisiae) carnitine o-acetyltransferase.
#  - Mammalian trifunctional fatty acid beta oxidation pathway enzyme.
#  - Mammalian, insect, plants, and Aspergillus uricase.
#  - Mammalian sterol carrier protein-2 high molecular form (SCP-X).
#  - Mammalian long chain alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase.
#  - Mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH).
#  - Firefly luciferase.
#  - Plants glycolate oxidase.
#  - Plants glyoxisomal isocitrate lyase.
#  - Plants and fungal glyoxisomal malate synthase.
#  - Trypanosoma glycosomal glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.
#  - Trypanosoma glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
#  - Yeast (H. polymorpha and Pichia pastoris) alcohol oxidase (AOX).
#  - Yeast (H. polymorpha) dihydroxy-acetone synthase (DHAS).
#  - Yeast (S. cerevisiae) catalase A.
#  - Yeast (S. cerevisiae) citrate synthase.

# 
# The precursor of  hormones  and other active  peptides  which are C-terminally
# amidated is always directly followed [1,2] by a glycine residue which provides
# the amide group, and  most often by at  least two  consecutive  basic residues
# (Arg or Lys) which generally function as an active peptide  precursor cleavage
# site.  Although all amino acids can be amidated,  neutral hydrophobic residues
# such as Val or Phe are good substrates, while  charged residues such as Asp or
# Arg  are much less reactive.  C-terminal  amidation has not  yet been shown to
# occur in unicellular organisms or in plants.
